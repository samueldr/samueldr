Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am an open source focused developer, doing a lot of stuff. I sometimes write link:https://samuel.dionne-riel.com/[on my website].

 - link:https://mobile-nixos.github.io/mobile-nixos/[Mobile NixOS], to abstract quirks around Mobile devices
 - link:https://tow-boot.org/[Tow-Boot], to make the boot experience boring
 - link:https://jovian-experiments.github.io/Jovian-NixOS/[Jovian NixOS], to get the Steam Deck experience, but using NixOS
 - link:https://github.com/celun/[celun], an early WIP toolset for building embedded Linux systems

There's also some other stuff here:

 - link:https://github.com/samueldr-wip/[samueldr-wip], WIP stuff, some good, some shenanigans

See also, misc stuff, nothing ready, but shows my varied skill set.
